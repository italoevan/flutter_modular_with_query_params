# Approaches

If you are using Dart, Modular can help you.
We have 3 package approaches to help with usage scenarios in Flutter, backend Dart or Direct usage in Dart scripts.

## Choosing an approach

- For Flutter applications, use the **flutter_modular** package.
- For applications using Shelf in the backend, use the **shelf_modular** package
- For applications using pure Dart, use the **modular_core** package

Each approach contains specific tools and helpers to better adapt the idea of "Smart Framework".
